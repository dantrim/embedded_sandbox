This implementation is based on the implementation found in the example
code associated with the Mastering STM32 guide written by Carmine Noviello.

The book is found online [here](https://leanpub.com/mastering-stm32) and the
corresponding implementation for a Nucleo-F446RE board is [here](https://github.com/cnoviello/mastering-stm32/tree/master/nucleo-f446RE/Middlewares/RingBuffer).
